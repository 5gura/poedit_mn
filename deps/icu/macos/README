The headers in this directory are for compiling on macOS.
macOS releases include the ICU binary, but not ICU headers.

For other platforms, installed ICU headers should be used rather than these.
They are specific to the macOS platform.

The headers here are from ICU version 70.1 downloaded from the ICU project.
https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/releases/tag/release-70-1

This is how WebKit does it, see https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/tree/main/Source/WTF/icu

The headers are unmodified, except for:

 1. #define UCONFIG_USE_LOCAL is added to uconfig.h
 2. uconfig_local.h is added with customization

The latter customizes the build to be binary compatible with macOS, namely

 - disables symbol renaming
 - disables deprecated APIs
 - disables C++ API that doesn't have stable ABI and is unavailable on Windows
